This is a little game with a few rules:
 1. 2-players are setting after each other a point on the field.
 2. you can only set a point to a field of your color
     or in the first two rounds also on neutral fields
 3. if you have 4 points at one field, you are attacking the neighbours.
     - every field around it gets your color and +1 point
     - the attacker field will set back to 0 points and gets neutral.
 4. the winner is the last one standing.
